(taken from june 12-june 18)
i think what you do is find the average size of a household in a county, then calculate a "FPL" for the average size of the houses, then convert the FPL percentages to actual dollar values, then you find how many houses are in that size of a bracket by interpolating the income brackets, and then divide that by the total number of houses. i think that works.

you need to get how much the FPL eligibility changed here: https://web.archive.org/web/20150317055712/http://kff.org:80/medicaid/fact-sheet/medicaid-eligibility-for-adults-as-of-january-1-2014


notes from Jun 17:
average size of a household in a county of those who are affected by medicaid expansion
calculate the federal poverty line by interpolating the 2014 poverty line
convert the percentage to an actual dollar value
how many houses are in that size of a bracket by 
# interpolating the income brackets, and then divide that by the total number of houses

average size of a household -> lets just use the total for now
adjusting it by parental status would be:
avgSizeParents = weightedAvg(averageHouseholdSize[c02,c03,c04], totalHouseholds[c02,c03,c04])
average size = weightedAvg(c(average size of a parent household, average size of non-parent household), c(number of adults that are parents that are newly eligible for ACA, number of adults that are not parents that are newly eligible for ACA)

these split by married-couple, male householder, female householder, and non-family
you have the number of households with children
number of total households
the average size of a household
total - numWithChildren = numWithoutChildren
avreaeg family size
size of household - family size = non-family household members

the problem is that we have the average size of married-couple, male householder, female householder, and non-family members, but we need to find the average size of a parent household and the size of a non-parent household

SKIP FOR NOW, will do later
