i think what you do is find the average size of a household in a county, then calculate a "FPL" for the average size of the houses, then convert the FPL percentages to actual dollar values, then you find how many houses are in that size of a bracket by interpolating the income brackets, and then divide that by the total number of houses. i think that works.
