"County-level estimates for the over 3,100 counties or county equivalents (e.g., parish, borough, municipality) in the 50 US states and the District of Columbia (DC) were based on indirect model-dependent estimates using Bayesian multilevel modeling techniques. This model-dependent approach uses a statistical model that "borrows strength" (a.k.a., Small Area Estimation) in making an estimate for one county from BRFSS data collected in other counties.3-5 For incidence rates of newly diagnosed diabetes, multilevel binomial regression models with random effects of demographic variables at the county level were developed.5 County-level prevalence was based on design-assisted model-based estimates using the power prior log-weights (PLOW) technique developed by Xie et al. Unique PLOW advantages include 1) using single-year BRFSS data rather combining years; 2) inclusion of historical data to define informative priors (power prior); 3) the integration of adjusted sample weights to account for BRFSS’ complex survey design; and 4) more timely estimates with smaller variance.3 Estimates were age adjusted to the 2000 US standard population using age groups, 20-44, 45-64, and 65 years or older.6 Estimates for Puerto Rico were not generated.
