7/10
states to potentially compare along their borders:
(non-expanded(as of ~2019) vs expanded in 2014):
tennessee & virginia vs kentucky
idaho vs washington and oregon
south dakota vs north dakota
wisconsin vs minnesota, michigan, iowa, illinois
texas vs new mexico, little bit of arkansas
mississippi vs arkansas
kansas vs colorado
missouri(MO) vs illinois, iowa, arkansas
nebraska vs iowa, colorado
oklahoma vs arkansas

shakier comparisons:
four corners comparison(?)
wyoming vs montana(2016)
maine vs new hampshire(late 2014)
mississippi(MS) vs louisiana(late 2016)
virginia vs west virginia, maryland (WV because of mountains, maryland because of DC)
utah vs nevada, colorado, arizona (utah's counties are just so huge)

i feel like i need to define how I include and exclude counties, and also maybe weight counties differently if they sprawl far from the border
i think a good enough metric is that if counties are touching the border, include them, unless they sprawl from the border by more than 50 miles
(most counties are ~25 miles across so normally this isn't a problem, more applicable in the west where counties are 100+ miles across)
also need to be wary of large cities (100k+), would probably distort the comparison

looking for large urban areas:
(https://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/DC2020/UA20/UA_2020_WallMap.pdf)

	boise city, spokane
south dakota vs north dakota
	none
wisconsin vs minnesota, michigan, iowa, illinois

	zip
missouri(MO) vs illinois, iowa, arkansas
	st louis, none for iowa, fayetteville for AR
nebraska vs iowa, colorado
