states to potentially compare along their borders:
looking at this: https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions-interactive-map/
(non-expanded(as of ~2019) vs expanded in 2014):
tennessee & virginia vs kentucky
idaho vs washington and oregon
south dakota vs north dakota
wisconsin vs minnesota, michigan, iowa, illinois
texas vs new mexico, little bit of arkansas
mississippi vs arkansas
kansas vs colorado
missouri(MO) vs illinois, iowa, arkansas
nebraska vs iowa, colorado
oklahoma vs arkansas

shakier comparisons:
four corners comparison(?)
wyoming vs montana(2016)
maine vs new hampshire(late 2014)
mississippi(MS) vs louisiana(late 2016)
virginia vs west virginia, maryland (WV because of mountains, maryland because of DC)
utah vs nevada, colorado, arizona (utah's counties are just so huge)

i feel like i need to define how I include and exclude counties, and also maybe weight counties differently if they sprawl far from the border
i think a good enough metric is that if counties are touching the border, include them, unless they sprawl from the border by more than 50 miles
(most counties are ~25 miles across so normally this isn't a problem, more applicable in the west where counties are 100+ miles across)
also need to be wary of large cities (100k+), would probably distort the comparison

looking for large urban areas:
(https://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/DC2020/UA20/UA_2020_WallMap.pdf)
tennessee & virginia vs kentucky
	nashville & clarksville are urban areas
idaho vs washington and oregon
	boise city, spokane
south dakota vs north dakota
	none
wisconsin vs minnesota, michigan, iowa, illinois
	minneapolis, chicago, duluth?
texas vs new mexico, little bit of arkansas
	el paso, texarkana?
mississippi vs arkansas
	none
kansas vs colorado
	zip
missouri(MO) vs illinois, iowa, arkansas
	st louis, none for iowa, fayetteville for AR
nebraska vs iowa, colorado
	omaha for iowa, none for colorado (kinda large counties though)
oklahoma vs arkansas
	fayetteville, fort smith, maybe tulsa? but i doubt it

i want to get some analysis going for the maps that I make

make both map-based plots and the normal XY-coordinate time series graphs:
plot heart disease mortality levels
plot insurance levels

also potentially look into some sort of representation comparing these counties to the rest of the nation based on population, employment, HDM, insurance, etc (population density?)

sessions (only 4 because I started really late):
1: plots
2: plots
3: unintentional second look at synthetic DID as I question this methodology!
4: try using the synthetic DID library on all the data, excluding the staggered states, and see what you get (just a curiosity)

ugh apparently old me missed that there are population estimates per county before 2010 (duh!), so I could redo the DiDTable to include 4 more years, which is probably a good idea! (https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/intercensal-2000-2010-counties.html)
https://www.bls.gov/lau/tables.htm#mcounty

so, add onto the tasks: create a new full didtable with 2006 to 2019 data

i'm just gonna make all the county groups now

finished up the code that compares the adjacent states, I have all the maps and plots

need to do the synthetic DID for all the groups, then send some results and thoughts to Dr. Palanki
	will require figuring out covariates ughh
might need to make the groups larger idk
also need to make the table go farther back

from now until 5pm I will work on extending the DiDTable back to 2006, ignoring my eagerness to try to add more stuff to it

i really should add average income and diabetes though

we're kind of in the endgame for the poster game, so I need to decide on the last few analysis items and then work on making this poster beautiful

goals until friday:

I think a good goal would be to add median income levels into the nationwide analysis, so I can say I included some socioeconomic factor, since that was one piece of feedback that I got last time and I didn't have a good explanation for. it shouldn't be that hard to add it to the didTable, and then to the analysis.

I would also like to do a synthetic DID nationally including covariates, but i don't know if that's attainable or useful. how would I explain why I used it on the poster?

I need to consider the change in insurance levels for the smaller adjacent comparisons (KFF table). do the ones that show an increase in mortality levels have a smaller or negligible treatment?
	or perhaps 

---------------------------------
new idea from wren: compare the amount of public insurance money spent on heart disease to the level of heart disease

plot change in heart disease and insurance for the whole nation
