investigating a few things right now:
-do we even have parallel trends in this context?
	-looking at this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8C1xaPoRvM&list=PLVObvb_htcuBt8mV9yNagt7hK9FL5KXeE&index=4
	-talks about the tests for parallel trends, the pretrends test being potentially faulty, and ways that you could still find some results depending on if you want to assume a non-parallel trend
	-uses HonestDiD package in R, should probably look into this, as well as pretrends package in R
	-requires more thinking about the influences on heart disease mortality, and what a predicted trend could look like (i don't know)
	-will watch this tonight: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-NkiA2jN7U
-looking at adjacent or geographically-near state groups for comparisons, is this a good idea or does it reduce my power too much?
-power analysis, how can we simulate the 2014 changes? can we simulate staggered changes as well? does using our actual data for a simulation make sense to do, given the change in trend?
-why is there a bump in the did estimate graph at REL_YEAR -4?
-what are synthetic controls (mentioned at the end of Roth's parallel trends video)? should I try to use that method?
	according to Roth (kind of), DiD and synthetic controls has sort of independently developed, and their researchers haven't really interacted much or considered each other very often

watched this video on synthetic control: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgfPTLqjUEE
essentially the idea is to create a counterfactual by finding many matching untreated groups and doing a weighted average, with the weights coming from minimizing the difference between the treatment group and the untreated group before the treatment happens
this requires a bunch of data on the features that could potentially influence the outcome, weighting those features on importance, then minimizing
i think it could be possible with our dataset, but we would need more factors, and also I think comparing counties that are directly near each other is a good idea
for example, comparing the bottom of kentucky to the top of tennessee, removing counties that are outliers in population or urbanness, or something like that. it's gonna be hard though
------------------------------------------
had a dizzying afternoon sorting through more papers n' stuff
(taken from SURE timesheet): watched this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2DzGAigTl4) about a relatively recent paper and recent new estimator called synthetic difference-in-differences, and a lot of the problems that I had with DiD seem moderately addressed by this estimator. I do worry that because some of the intuition is based on TWFE, that similar distortions and bias from staggered treatments will also occur in the SDID, maybe I'll ask Goodman-Bacon or try to find someone talking about that online. the paper seems highly cited (>170 citations), but obviously that doesn't give it credibility. I think I need to read/watch this paper next because somehow I missed this entire synthetic controls idea

after some more searching, I found this paper (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165176522003482) talking about staggered SDID. he made an R library (https://github.com/zachporreca/staggered_adoption_synthdid) but actually recommends this library because its more up-to-date (https://github.com/TJhon/ssynthdid)
	fun fact about zachary porreca, he actually got his master's and his doctorate in ecomonics from WVU
