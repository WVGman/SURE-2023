goal today: redo the nationwide two-stage analysis with median income as the covariate
extra cherry on top: same thing but with the smaller adjacent groups

sessions:
1: look for any data before 2010 for 20 mins, if no data, import the median income data, clean it, add it to the didTable. if there is data, make a new didTable with data from 2006-2018
didn't finish didTable, but did clean the data pretty easily with dplyr functions

future work:
SDID with staggered treatment on a national scale (https://github.com/TJhon/ssynthdid)
look more into HonestDID (https://asheshrambachan.github.io/assets/files/hpt-draft.pdf, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-NkiA2jN7U)
heterogeneous treatment sizes (countinuous treatment)
	

general note:
i don't know how to organize myself very well, i think i need a better system, but I don't know what
maybe I need to do something where I can infodump into a document, and then at the end of each day I do a summary of the major findings. i kind of already do that, but not super well because things fall through the cracks. i also need a way to keep my priorities straight-- i think something like a physical whiteboard would be useful for future projects

make nationwide maps of change in heart disease mortality and change in insurance coverage from 2010 to 2019
look at the actual change in insurance coverage in the adjacent groups
start on the poster

it's now the 18th
i have a new idea, instead make a scatterplot comparing the change in heart disease mortality compared to the change in insurance coverage, to show a correlation
ok i'm doin that real quick, the SDID stuff is laggy
ah mann these scatterplots SUCK. maybe i could use it on my poster as an illustration of why the problem is difficult to solve idk

ok i need to figure out my narrative for my poster, what do I want to emphasize?

-nationally, states that expanded medicaid had significant reductions in heart disease mortality compared to states that did not expand medicaid

found a picture of scripps posters (https://www.scripps.edu/_files/pdfs/science-medicine/translational-institute/2022-End-of-Program-Intern-Poster-Symposium.pdf), i saw a poster that had a gradient to signify the increasing complexity of methodology in their study design, and I think that's genius (top left-ish)
I also like how clean the posters look in general

make a virginia vs west virginia comparison for the poster
maybe a whole appalachia analysis, or even find a healthcare region map by some accredited institution
