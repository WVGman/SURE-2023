goal today: redo the nationwide two-stage analysis with median income as the covariate
extra cherry on top: same thing but with the smaller adjacent groups

sessions:
1: look for any data before 2010 for 20 mins, if no data, import the median income data, clean it, add it to the didTable. if there is data, make a new didTable with data from 2006-2018
didn't finish didTable, but did clean the data pretty easily with dplyr functions

future work:
SDID with staggered treatment on a national scale (https://github.com/TJhon/ssynthdid)
look more into HonestDID (https://asheshrambachan.github.io/assets/files/hpt-draft.pdf, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-NkiA2jN7U)
heterogeneous treatment sizes (countinuous treatment)
	

general note:
i don't know how to organize myself very well, i think i need a better system, but I don't know what
maybe I need to do something where I can infodump into a document, and then at the end of each day I do a summary of the major findings. i kind of already do that, but not super well because things fall through the cracks. i also need a way to keep my priorities straight-- i think something like a physical whiteboard would be useful for future projects

7/18
make nationwide maps of change in heart disease mortality and change in insurance coverage from 2010 to 2019
look at the actual change in insurance coverage in the adjacent groups
start on the poster
