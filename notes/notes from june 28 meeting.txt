6/28 notes

talking points before:
talk about the feedback
comparing geographically-near states (wren)
	summarized it as "we did a national analysis and found that the effect of medicaid is state specific, because the implementation was different depending on the state"
	
---------------------------------
make the same plots for employment as you did for population
add SD to the population averages, make the Y-axis go from 80k to 120k
make it more like a story with the plots -> what are we using the covariates for? 
add the description of the DiD equation, maybe reference the videos
he liked the geographically-near state comparison idea
